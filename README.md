# 🌌 Tinyverse

A small interactive universe simulation built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).  
This project is an experiment to learn and explore the capabilities of Three.js in 3D rendering and animation.

## 🌠 What is Tinyverse?

Tinyverse simulates a miniature mock universe with:

- ⭐ Stars
- 🪐 Planets orbiting those stars
- 🌙 Moons orbiting the planets

Each body follows a simple orbital pattern to give a sense of motion and structure in 3D space.

---

## 🧪 Purpose

This project is built as a **learning exercise** in Three.js — especially focusing on:

- Creating and managing hierarchical 3D objects
- Simulating orbital motion
- Optimizing 3D scenes for performance

---

## 🕹️ Controls

- **Click** on a planetary body to display information
- **Click again** to focus the camera on it
- **Press `Space`** to pause or resume the simulation
- **Press `O`** to toggle orbit lines on or off
- Use your mouse to **rotate and pan** the scene

---

## ⚠️ Performance Note

Tinyverse is still a work in progress and **needs heavy optimization** — especially for larger systems with many orbits and objects.  
Expect better performance on desktop.

---

## 🧰 Built With

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- HTML / JavaScript

---

## 📌 Todo / Future Improvements

- Optimize rendering performance
- Improve the realism of information such as temperature, radius, and star type
- Smooth camera transitions
- Add background stars and ambient effects
- Make system generation configurable
